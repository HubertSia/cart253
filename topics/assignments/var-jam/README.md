## Description

This project is about making a piano keyboard more fun and engaging for the user. I programmed six variations of a keyboard to experiment with different ways of creating enjoyment.

We start with the normal piano, which serves as the default version and our control for comparing the variations.

Self-Drawing Piano
The second variation is the self-drawing piano. When you hit a piano key, it generates random shapes that draw themselves on the canvas. The eerie sound of the piano reflects the inner pain of thinking up ideas as an artist.

Particles with Camera Background
The third one adds particles—but with a twist. I included the camera as the background to make it stand out. Each key press triggers particles of different colors, adding a cool effect.

Christmas-Themed Particle Piano
The fourth one is a Christmas-themed particle piano. It features a particle system on the keyboard and background, with Christmas sounds for each key. There’s also an audio visualizer that looks like icicles to match the holiday vibe.

Positivity Piano
The fifth one is all about positivity. The keyboard makes cat meowing sounds—because why not?—and displays positive messages at the same time. I also added a secret button, just for fun. The idea behind this is that life is always filled with positivity if you look for it.

Donkey Kong Piano
The sixth is a callback to the Art-Jam. Donkey Kong is back! Every key press generates a new Donkey Kong head, and the keyboard sounds come straight from the DK Rap itself.
