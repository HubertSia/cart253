# Starting points

**Moshi tries to eat apples as much as possible before Browser get**

The players are playing as Moshi, the friendly dinosaur, is very hungry. So he is going to eat some apple-wings in a local forest.

Suddenly, a the big bad turtle, Browser, tries to collect the apple-wings for his personal gains.

Make sure Moshi eats as possible before Browser gets all 10 apple-wings and blows up the forest

**Ideas and features**

- With the Frogfrogfrog project as our base template. It's going to be revamp game with a bootleg characters of Yoshi and Bowser
- A title with instructions, and ending screen.
- A mic control system wich allows the players to shout to activate the tongue. (Suggested to use the map function)
- The sound plays when ate the flying apples
- Apple wings spawns at a random positions (from left to right or right to left)
- Make sure the players grab as much the apple-wings as possible. If players miss 10 apples, Browser wins a it is consider a game over.
