## Description

This is a self-drawing egg that leaves a trace of its path and changes as it bounces off the wall. It will play the Mii menu theme music and make a 'pong' sound when it bounces. When the user clicks any mouse button, it will display four Donkey Kong heads and play the DK rap. Both of these modes represent calm and funky, respectively, in their own way. As for why I chose the DK head, it is my signature way of trying out a new programming language. It’s also my way of showing people that programming doesn’t always have to be complex or serious; it can be fun and hilarious, as seen in this assignments.
